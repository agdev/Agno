## Next Steps

### **Immediate Priorities**
1. **Start with Phase 1**: Create required Pydantic models
2. **Focus on Phase 2**: Fix workflow state management
3. **Implement Phase 3**: Get summary system working

### **Critical Path**
```
Models (Phase 1) → Workflow State (Phase 2) → Summary System (Phase 3) → Message Tracking (Phase 6) → Testing (Phase 8)
```

### **Parallel Work Opportunities**
- Phases 4-5 (Agent model fixes) can be done in parallel with Phase 6
- Phase 7 (UI updates) depends on Phases 4-6 completion
- Phase 8 (testing) should be ongoing throughout implementation

## Risk Factors

### **High Risk Items**
- **Session state structure changes**: May break existing session data
- **Agent model changes**: Could affect existing API responses
- **Storage persistence**: Need to verify Agno storage works correctly

### **Dependencies**
- **Agno framework**: Updates may affect storage behavior
- **Pydantic models**: Serialization/deserialization must work with storage
- **Streamlit session**: Integration with Agno workflow sessions

### **Mitigation Strategies**
- **Incremental testing**: Test each phase before moving to next
- **Backup current code**: Create backup before major changes
- **Graceful fallbacks**: Handle missing or invalid session data

## Notes & Observations

### **Planning Complete** ✅
- Comprehensive plan created with detailed implementation steps
- Task breakdown complete with time estimates
- Dependencies and risk factors identified
- Ready to begin implementation

### **Key Insights**
- Moving from agent-level memory to workflow-level state is the core fix (architectural problem, not configuration)
- Structured Pydantic models will improve data flow consistency
- Agno's session_state provides the persistence mechanism we need
- Manual report composition will be more reliable than agent-based
- Composite session ID (`user_id_session_id`) ensures proper user isolation

### **Success Criteria**
- Conversations persist across app restarts
- Summaries generate automatically and accurately
- All agents return structured data instead of markdown
- UI properly formats and displays structured responses
- Multiple users can use the system concurrently without interference
