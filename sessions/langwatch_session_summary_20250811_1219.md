- **Rationale**: Financial compliance requirements, hybrid deployment needs, advanced monitoring features

### 3. Framework Integration Approach
- **Decision**: Use decorator pattern for seamless Agno integration
- **Rationale**: Minimal code changes, framework-agnostic design, maintains existing patterns

## Issues Encountered and Resolved

### Issue 1: Research Scope
- **Problem**: Initial request was broad - needed structured approach
- **Resolution**: Used TodoWrite tool to break down into specific research tasks
- **Outcome**: Systematic research covering all aspects (capabilities, comparison, integration, planning)

### Issue 2: Integration Complexity
- **Problem**: Risk of disrupting existing Langfuse setup
- **Resolution**: Designed dual observability strategy
- **Outcome**: Risk-mitigated approach allowing gradual adoption

### Issue 3: Financial Domain Requirements
- **Problem**: Generic monitoring vs financial-specific needs
- **Resolution**: Identified LangWatch's financial domain advantages (compliance, cost tracking, quality assessment)
- **Outcome**: Clear justification for LangWatch over Langfuse

## Research Findings Summary

### LangWatch Advantages for Financial Applications:
1. **Superior Evaluation Capabilities**: Real-time evaluation engine with financial domain features
2. **Compliance Monitoring**: Built-in PII detection, content moderation, custom rules engine
3. **Cost Optimization**: Multi-provider cost tracking with budget alerts
4. **Enterprise Features**: Production-ready monitoring, alerting, hybrid deployment
5. **Quality Assurance**: Automated regression detection, A/B testing capabilities

### Integration Strategy:
- **Dual Observability**: Run both Langfuse and LangWatch in parallel
- **Gradual Rollout**: 6-week implementation across development → staging → production
- **Minimal Disruption**: Decorator-based integration with existing Agno workflow
- **Risk Mitigation**: Complete rollback procedures and fallback mechanisms

## Performance Implications

### Expected Benefits:
- **Monitoring Overhead**: <5% response time impact (with proper sampling)
- **Enhanced Visibility**: Real-time agent performance tracking
- **Cost Optimization**: Detailed cost breakdown across LLM providers
- **Quality Improvement**: Automated evaluation and regression detection

### Risk Mitigation:
