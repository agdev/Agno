2. **Add LangWatch**: Layer on top for advanced evaluation, compliance monitoring, and financial-specific features
3. **Gradual Migration**: Slowly migrate critical monitoring to LangWatch over time
4. **Risk Mitigation**: Maintain fallback capabilities with existing Langfuse setup

### Integration Architecture

```python
# Dual Observability Decorator
def dual_observability(langwatch_type: str = None, langwatch_name: str = None):
    def decorator(func):
        # Apply both Langfuse and LangWatch tracing
        langfuse_decorated = langfuse.observe()(func)
        if langwatch_type:
            langwatch_decorated = langwatch.span(type=langwatch_type, name=langwatch_name)(langfuse_decorated)
        else:
            langwatch_decorated = langwatch.trace()(langfuse_decorated)
        return langwatch_decorated
    return decorator
```

### Configuration Management

```python
class ObservabilitySettings:
    enable_langfuse: bool = True
    enable_langwatch: bool = False  # Enable gradually
    langwatch_api_key: Optional[str] = None
    langwatch_endpoint: str = "https://app.langwatch.ai"
    financial_evaluation_enabled: bool = False
    compliance_monitoring_enabled: bool = False
