    }
```

**Cost Tracking Integration**:

```python
@langwatch.span(type="api_call", name="Financial_API")
def fetch_financial_data(symbol: str):
    # Track both LLM and API costs
    with langwatch.track_cost(provider="financial_modeling_prep") as cost_tracker:
        result = financial_api.get_data(symbol)
        cost_tracker.record_usage(api_calls=1, cost=0.01)
